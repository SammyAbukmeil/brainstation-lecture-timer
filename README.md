# Brainstation Lecture Timer

A tool to help educators keep track of how much time & lectures they've got left.

# Features

Input: - How much time you have (in minutes) - How many slides you need to get through - Click go

You can click each slide to mark it as done

## Potential Future Features

- Some slides take longer to go through (inc. a code along for that slides material), so perhaps a "weight" can be added to each slide. A higher weight would be seen visiaully by a bigger slide block.

- (If possible) An API connection to google sheets to automatically check off a slide as done
